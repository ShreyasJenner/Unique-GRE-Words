# Unique-GRE-Words
Vince's GRE Vocab excel sheet compiles all possible vocabulary words from most sites. It allows a GRE applicant to get a single list for all possible GRE word. However, many words are repeated and if a student tries to make his own flash cards from that then finding duplicate words is tough.

This project removes all duplicted words and exports the unique words to an excel sheet for easy viewing.
The project is written in python using jupyter notebook
It makes use of the pandas library in python
